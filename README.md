## the-devops-process

### Summary
The purpose of this repository is to provide an app and instructions for practicing DevSecOps principles using OpenShift.  The app isn't important.  It is a simple static web site.  All we really need is something we can change (Dev) that will then kick off a pipeline (Sec) that will then re-deploy the app automatically (Ops).  This repo is meant to document the steps needed to practice this DevSecOps methodology.
